* The results are showing that there is a high percentage of employees in the senior positions and therefore could retire at any time.
* Urban cities have a ratio of about 2 drivers per ride, (more drivers than required rides).
* The average fares per ride and per driver is higher in rural and suburban cities compared to the urban cities, due to the higher ride demand compared to available drivers. 
* Total fare revenue is higher in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities, due to the total amount of rides (61% higher than suburban and 92% higher than rural). See weekly total fare by city plot.
